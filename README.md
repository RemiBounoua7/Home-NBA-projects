# Home-NBA-projects
This is the HQ from where all my NBA viz projects are hosted. With links referring to every relevant pages / datasets / scripts.
What I wanted to do with these is simply answer some questions I had, and see if data could shed some light to it all, helping me and everyone learn in the process.

Feel free to click on the question that interests you the most, and see if my answers and my methodology help you learn new things. Also, please give me feedbacks, on what things you would've done differently, this helps me get better at it and I can improve my craft.

### 'The Championship Corner' : what makes teams title contenders ?
\

### When is it not 'too early to tell' anymore ?
\

### What makes a Superteam ? Are they successful ?
\

Finally, if you have ideas of questions that you ask yourself, that could benefit from the same treatment, please, either do what I did or tell me. I want your ideas to see the light of day, whether through my work or your own. I started this as a hobby because I was inspired by other content creators, so if I can have the same impact for 1 other person, I would be delighted.

Have a nice read !
